# Jardines Yacht Reservation System
**Organization:** Jardine Matheson (July 2018 â€“ August 2019)

**Position:** *Agile Intern Developer / Project Manager*

**Project Description:** Used a reservation platform service provided by [Planyo](https://www.planyo.com/) to built a Yacht Reservation System. Configured the already provided standard frontend from [the platform](https://www.planyo.com/) using basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript scripts** to meet other Company specific requirements. Extended the pricing logic provided by [the platform](https://www.planyo.com/) by using a **PHP script** and hosting it on **AWS EC2**. Used **LAMP Stack** for server configuration and **AWS SES (Simple Email Service)** for setting up SMTP.

*Note: Due to platform restrictions and copyright issues (no longer being part of the company), I don't have access to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript scripts for demonstration. I can only demonstrate the PHP script I wrote.*
