# GEO Stats Visualizer

**Project Description:** An application to visualize the international students' data.
* Used **[RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/)** to give **Modular structure** to the code and handle the **dependencies** properly by **clearly declaring them** in an entry point of the application (in my case main.js).
* Used **[BackBone.js](https://backbonejs.org/#)** as an **MVC** (Model, View, Collection) framework to further organise the code into different parts with each part responsible for a specific component of the application.
* For styling and presentation, used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
* Used **PHP** and **Classic ASP with VBScript** to write server-side scripts.
* Used **APACHE Webserver** for development and staging, and **IIS** for production.

Did **[end-to-end development](http://www.rapidsofttechnologies.com/end-to-end-website-development.php)** and deployed the application in around 2 weeks.

*Please note that due to data privcacy issues, the application is not available and accessible for general public which is why I have attached a short recording (GIF) for demonstration. If you want to have a proper look at the video, please watch it **[here](https://youtu.be/ZrbmliSQjhs)**.*
