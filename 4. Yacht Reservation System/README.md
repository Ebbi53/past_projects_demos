# Jardines Yacht Reservation System

**Project Description:** 
* Used a reservation platform service provided by [Planyo](https://www.planyo.com/) to built a Yacht Reservation System.
* Configured the already provided standard frontend from [the platform](https://www.planyo.com/) using basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript scripts** to meet other Company specific requirements.
* Used **[Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/)** to **transpile** the JS code from ES6 to ES5 and to include **polyfills** for IE compatibility.
* Used  a **PHP script** to extend the pricing logic provided by [the platform](https://www.planyo.com/) and hosted it on **[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)**.
* Used **LAMP Stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) for server configuration and **[AWS SES (Simple Email Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)** for setting up SMTP. Enabled **SSL/TLS** using **[Letâ€™s Encrypt Certificate Authority](https://letsencrypt.org/)**.

*Note: Due to platform restrictions and copyright issues (no longer being part of the company), I don't have access to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript scripts for demonstration. I can only share the PHP script I wrote.*

*Also, the platform is for internal employees only and not for general public which is why I have attached a short recording  (GIF) for demonstration. If you want to have a proper look at the video, please either watch it **[here]()** or download the **.mov** video file from above*
