# Jardines eLeave System

**Project Description:** A Leave management system which allows all the employees to apply for leaves and check their leave records. On top of this, Managers and Team heads can endorse, approve, and/or reject their team members' leaves. This system was founded few years ago and I helped with its upgrade and maintenance in the following ways:

* Upgraded the standard HTML tables into more interactive tables with the ability to sort/order, group, and search/filter using a plugin called **[DataTables](https://datatables.net/)**. Also, made the tables more responsive and collapsable.
* Used **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** to improved the UI of the application by making it more interactive and responsive.
* Worked with an **XML API** implemented using **[FileMaker](https://www.filemaker.com/)** database.
* Migrated the dependencies (libraries, frameworks) to the newer and latest versions.

*Please note that this platform is for internal employees only and not for general public which is why I have attached a recording (GIF) for demonstration. If you want to have a proper look at the video, please either watch it **[here](https://youtu.be/FmH1IODMrqw)** or download the **.mov** video file from above*
